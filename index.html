    <p>My Name is Dawn Dinham.  I live in Toronto's West End with my husband and daughter.  I have the most amazing daughter in the world!
    I enjoy coding but not internet humour for some reason.  I also enjoy doing things off-line like playing the piano and reading.
    I am looking forward to finding a career where I can problem solve and learn new ideas instead of doing the same thing every day.
    I will be celebrating my 39th birthday for the 3rd time this November.
